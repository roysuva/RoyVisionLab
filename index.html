We are interested in understanding how cell types in the retina shape distinct computations relevant for behavior. We use state-of-the-art large-scale electrophysiology, light-sheet imaging, genetic and viral tools, to map the cell-type specific circuits and study their functions in the context of natural vision and visual disorders. We use mice and tree shrew as model organisms to explore these questions in a comparative framework and test strategies for intervention in diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.
