        <p>Tree shrew is a mammal with a highly developed visual system that has been used extensively for studying cortical visual processing and refractive errors such as myopia. It has a cone-rich retina, a foveal analog, and close genomic relationship with primates. It's two major retinorecipient targets - the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus, have well-defined structures and are laminated, suggesting complex higher visual functions.</p>
        <p>We use viral techniques and electrophysiological measurements to distinguish the morphology and functions of different retinal ganglion cell types in the tree shrew retina and map retinal projections to subcortical targets that are involved in visually guided behaviors.   </p>

        <p>Dopamine is a key neuromodulator in the retina that regulates functions from light adaptation to circadian rhythm. It is also involved in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy that leads to progressive vision loss. We study the neuromodulatory role of dopamine in parallel processing and its potential neuroprotective functions against retinal diseases.</p>

        <p>Superior colliculus is a major retinorecipient hub involved in visual and visuomotor tasks such as movement detection, saccadic eye movements and attention. It is thought that superior colliculus receives visual input from multiple retinal ganglion cell types. In this collaborative work, we are optimizing viral delivery to retrogradely target retinal ganglion cells that form the retinotectal pathways in rodents and primates. </p>

        <p>Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy where damage to the optic nerve slowly results in the death of retinal ganglion cells, causing vision loss. Intraocular pressure is a primary risk factor in glaucoma and is known to alter retinal signaling in ways that are not fully understood.

        We showed in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03317-5">recent study</a> that certain retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types exhibit a receptive field organization that facilitates efficient coding of natural scenes. There are more than 40 different RGC types in the mouse retina and about 20 different RGC types in the primate retina. Does this organizational principle extend to other RGC types? Are there RGC types that violate this principle? We are exploring these questions using a combination of large-scale electrophysiology and computational modeling.
