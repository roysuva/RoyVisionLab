          <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;"> Dr. Suva Roy is trained in physics and neuroscience. He spent his graduate years at Indiana University Bloomington, studying the visual system of the fly using single-cell electrophysiology and methods of information theory. As a postdoc at Duke University and subsequently as a project scientist at UCLA, he worked on the mammalian retina across different species, to explore circuit computations to population encoding of stimuli relevant for behavior. He has developed novel imaging techniques and algorithms for studying precise spatiotemporal dynamics in bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells in ex-vivo retina. His research interests are directed at uncovering fundamental mechanisms of visual signaling, and how signaling is disrupted and can be restored in retinal diseases. Dr. Roy holds a K99 Career Transition Award from NIH (NEI).  </p>
