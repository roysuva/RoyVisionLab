      Dr. Suva Roy is trained in physics and neuroscience. He spent his graduate years at Indiana University
      Bloomington, studying the visual system of the fly using single-cell electrophysiology and methods of information theory. As a
      postdoc at Duke University and subsequently as a project scientist at UCLA, he worked on the mammalian retina,
      exploring molecular mechanisms in the developing retina, to circuit computations and population encoding of
      ethologically relevant stimuli. He has developed novel imaging techniques and algorithms for studying precise
      spatiotemporal dynamics in bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells in ex-vivo retina. His research interests are
      directed at studying mechanisms that shape visual signaling in retinal cells and how signaling is disrupted and
      can
      be restored in retinal diseases. Dr. Roy holds a K99 Career Transition Award from NIH (NEI).
